# Singleton MonoBehaviour for Unity Projects
Implementation of the Singleton Design Pattern to Unity MonoBehaviours.
This is useful when you need a single instance of a class and wants to tweak its properties in the editor.

#### Features:
* creates the Singleton instance automatically
* Singleton is ready no matter where or when you need it in your code
* grants the Singleton uniqueness (just one active instance at time)
* if there is already an instance in the Scene, uses it
* optinally makes the instance persistent through scenes

This implementation is a work in progress and it's widely open to suggestions.
